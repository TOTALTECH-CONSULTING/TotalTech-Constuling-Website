name: "Next generation of presales experts "
position: Noham Medyouni - Office of the CTO @ Dell
quote: During my career at Dell Technologies, I had the privilege of being
  coached by Bertrand Lalanne when he was VP of EMEA Presales. His leadership
  was a turning point for how we, as presales, positioned ourselves within the
  organization and with our customers, and his commitment to talent development
  fostered a new generation of presales experts. Through his attentiveness and
  demanding yet caring approach, he pushed me to refine my vision, elevate my
  impact as an Enterprise Architect, and build a community spirit among EMEA
  experts.
