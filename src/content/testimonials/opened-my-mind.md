name: Opened my mind
position: Herve Gilloury - Advisory Systems Engineer, France @ Dell
quote: I met Bertrand while working at EMC2, and his dual understanding of
  French and English cultures helped me navigate the complexities of the company
  merger with DELL Technologies. His mentoring opened my mind to improving
  various aspects of my work, particularly in communication and methodology,
  helping me to progress both professionally and personally.
