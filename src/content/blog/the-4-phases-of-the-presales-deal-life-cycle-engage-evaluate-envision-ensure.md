In this article, I  I will refer to an SE (Sales Engineer) as a professional working within the Presales function, which includes titles like Presales Consultant, Solution Consultant, Technical Consultant, and Technical Seller.  I will also refer to the potential buyer generically as the customer (whether it is an existing customer or prospect). 

# The 4 Phases of the Presales Deal Life Cycle: Engage, Evaluate, Envision, Ensure

In today’s competitive B2B environment, SE's are critical in shaping the path from lead to a closed deal. A well-managed presales cycle ensures not only that sales targets are more likely to be met but that the customer’s needs are fully understood and addressed. The presales cycle consists of distinct phases that work together to guide the process. By understanding each phase, SE's  can increase their chances of closing successful deals.  In this article, we’ll break down the four main phases of the presales deal life cycle—**Engage, Evaluate, Envision, and Ensure**—and explore how each contributes to driving success.

## Phase 1: Engage – Laying the Foundation

**What’s Involved?**

The Engage phase is the first step in building a relationship with the prospect. This is the stage where SE's , in collaboration with the sales team, initiate contact and begin gathering information about the customer’s needs, goals, and pain points. It's the phase for asking the right questions and understanding the key challenges the customer is facing.

During **Engage**, SE's aim to build rapport with the customer and gain a deeper understanding of their business and technical environment. The SE will aim to become the **"Trusted Advisor"** (more on this in an article to follow).    Every SE should have a **game plan** on how this phase should be done.  It should include some **repeatable deliverables** such as discovery workshops, questionnaires, etc.  There is also an opportunity during that phase to **inspire** the customer by sharing what other customers in the same industry/segment are doing with the technology you are offering.  SE's should be prepared to share some anonymized information about other accounts, to both open the opportunity wider and demonstrate **credibility**.  Sometimes a reference call will be required with a happy customer. Sometimes the opportunity will be led by and RFP/RFI framework which makes it more difficult, but establishing rapport and trust in any way possible prior to responding is key.

The goal is to gather as much relevant information as possible to establish a clear understanding of what the prospect needs, what problems they are trying to solve, and any existing solutions they are currently using.

**Why It’s Important**

**Engage** sets the tone for the entire presales cycle. It is the foundation of the relationship, establishing trust and clear communication. A solid **Engage** phase ensures that the SE is focused on the right customer and aligned with their needs, setting the stage for more tailored and effective conversations later on.

## Phase 2: Evaluate – Assessing the Fit

**What’s Involved?**

Once the customer's needs are better understood, the **Evaluate** phase begins.   SE's should think of the 
**Engage** phase as a **qualifying** stage, gathering high level information about business goals, customer's aspirations, existing solutions, etc.  The **Evaluate** phase however is a **quantifying** stage, where data is king.   

In this phase it is critical that the SE not only uses available data to quantify the customer's existing environment performance, cost, metrics around issues etc. but also initiates some kind of assessment using **data collection tools**.  Obtaining the customer's agreement to perform such data collection is critical and if the customer is reluctant to agree to this, the SE must articulate the importance of collecting this data to ensure the proposed solution will meet the expected requirements.  Data collection tools, combined with **structured questionnaires** and interviews with key stakeholders are very important.  The more accurate the analysis of the current state is, the more relevant the proposed solution will be.  Back at base, SE's should also conduct internal assessments such as **technical reviews** and   **competitive analysis**, to understand how the solution compares to alternatives in the market. This phase is crucial in identifying any gaps in the solution and adjusting the approach if necessary.

**Why It’s Important**

There are always some macro level factors to consider in specific industries and public sector customers (Compliance, politics, environmental, ethical, etc.)  but ultimately the customer will likely be looking for a solution that is either/or **1) more cost effective, 2) more flexible 3) more performant/scalable**. 

A thorough evaluation ensures that SE's offer a solution that is genuinely suitable for the prospect. This is a key stage for ensuring that any solution presented is aligned with the prospect’s needs. Proper evaluation helps avoid wasting time on unsuitable solutions and ensures the team is addressing the right challenges in the right way.

## Phase 3: Envision – Designing the Tailored Solution

**What’s Involved?**

The **Envision** phase is where SE's begin to design the solution. At this stage, the SE takes the information from the Engage and Evaluate phases and designs a tailored solution that directly addresses the customer’s needs and challenges. The solution might involve product configurations, customizations, or even integrations with existing systems to ensure the proposal is as relevant and effective as possible**.  Services are also a critical component of the solution** (both pre and post implementation).

This phase also involves collaborating with different departments— technical teams, product experts, implementation teams and sometimes even legal or finance —to ensure the solution **1) meets all the necessary criteria 2) is priced as competitively as possible and 3) will provide an opportunity to expand the business.** The SE  needs to present a vision for how the solution will deliver value and achieve the customer’s goals.  SE's should use **peer reviews** during this stage to minimise the risk of errors, wrong assumptions and better understand **potential undocumented product behaviour** that peer SE's might have encountered in the past.

This stage might go through several iterations as the **RIGHT** solution, will always be a factor of **cost vs performance vs features** and the customer might be willing to compromise on one or more of those.

**Why It’s Important**

Envisioning a solution is the turning point in the presales cycle, as it moves from theoretical to practical. It shows the customer that the team understands their challenges and has a solution that addresses them. A well-envisioned solution will increase confidence and excitement, making the customer feel that their problem is being solved in a meaningful way.

## Phase 4: Ensure – Overcoming Obstacles and Closing the Deal

**What’s Involved?**

The **Ensure** phase is the final step in the presales deal life cycle, where SE's  work to close the deal. This phase involves addressing any remaining objections, particularly competitive ones, reinforcing the value of the solution, and ensuring the prospect feels confident in their decision to move forward.  During this phase, presales teams may provide final **demonstrations**, share **case studies** or **testimonials**, and clarify any technical or business-related concerns the prospect may have. The goal is to remove any lingering doubts, solidify the solution’s benefits, and ensure that the prospect is ready to commit.

In addition to handling objections, SE's will  also work closely with the sales team to finalize pricing, terms, and implementation details, making sure everything is aligned before closing the deal.

**Why It’s Important**

The **Ensure** phase is essential because it’s where the SE combats final **objections**, solidifies **trust**, and pushes the deal to **closure**. By addressing last-minute concerns, reinforcing the solution's value, and emphasizing why it’s the best choice, SE's can ensure a smooth transition to the sales team for final pricing negotiations and a successful deal closure.

## Conclusion

The presales deal life cycle—comprising the phases of **Engage, Evaluate, Envision, and Ensure**—plays a pivotal role in successfully closing deals. By understanding the prospect’s needs, designing tailored solutions, and addressing objections, SE's guide the sales process, increase the chances of closing deals, and build lasting relationships with clients.

Each phase of the presales cycle provides a strategic opportunity to demonstrate value, engage with the prospect, and differentiate from the competition. A well-executed presales process helps close more deals faster, ensuring both customer satisfaction and business growth.
