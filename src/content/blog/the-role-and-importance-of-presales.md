*In this article, I will use Presales as a broad term to encompass roles such as Sales Engineering,
Solution Engineering, Solution Consulting, Technology Consulting, and Technical
Sales. Additionally, I will refer to an SE (Sales Engineer) as a professional working
within the Presales function, which includes titles like Presales Consultant,
Solution Consultant, Technical Consultant, and Technical Seller.*

The Presales function is essential for any organization that sells technology. While the
technology itself can vary, its complexity dictates the need for SEs. For basic
products or services, post-sales technical support may suffice, and in smaller
companies, this role may even overlap with engineering. However, as technology
grows more complex and valuable, the need for a dedicated SE team becomes more
apparent.

The Presales function acts as the bridge connecting various departments: sales, product
management, engineering, marketing, technical support, operations, senior
leadership, and partners. Below, I outline how SEs work across these teams:

#### **1. Sales**

**Collaboration:** SEs work closely with the sales team to understand customer needs and customize solutions. They provide technical expertise and address any technical questions early in the sales process.

**Support:** They assist in presentations, product demos, and technical proof of concepts (POCs) to help close deals.

**Bridge:** Acting as a liaison, SEs ensure the technical aspects of a solution align with customer requirements.

#### 2. Product Management/Engineering

**Feedback Loop:** SEs offer valuable customer insights, including preferences, pain points, and feature requests.

**Customization:** They collaborate with product teams to tailor solutions that address specific customer needs, especially for complex products.

#### 3. Marketing

**Content Development:** SEs contribute to the creation of technical content like whitepapers, case studies, and solution briefs, emphasizing the product's technical strengths.

**Customer Insights:** They provide input on market trends and customer demands, helping to position products effectively.

#### 4. Customer/Technical Support

**Implementation Support:** Post-sale, SEs may assist customer support teams to ensure smooth technical implementations and resolve issues promptly.

**Knowledge Transfer:** They ensure a seamless transition from sales to support, equipping the team with the necessary technical knowledge.

#### 5. Operations

**Solution Delivery:** SEs collaborate with the operations team to ensure the proposed solution is operationally feasible.

**Risk Management:** They identify potential risks and work with other teams to address them during implementation.

#### 6. Senior Leadership (C-Level or Executive Team)

**Strategic Input:** SEs provide feedback to senior leadership on customer demands, competitive positioning, and market opportunities, which helps shape business decisions and product roadmaps.

#### 7. External Partners/Alliances

**Partnerships:** SEs work with third-party vendors or resellers to integrate solutions and offer joint products to customers.

**Collaboration for Complex Deals:** They collaborate with external partners to provide specialized technical solutions for large or complex sales

In summary, Presales serves a critical role in aligning technical and business objectives, ensuring successful sales and customer satisfaction.

## The Challenges of Leading an SE Team

While SEs are critical for business success, leading an SE team comes with its own set of challenges. Effective SE leadership requires a balance of technical expertise, customer engagement, and strategic alignment. Below are some key challenges that SE managers face:

#### 1. Aligning Sales and Technical Teams

**Communication Gap:** Bridging the communication gap between sales and technical teams can be challenging. Sales may not fully understand the technical aspects, and technical teams may not fully grasp the sales strategy or customer needs.

**Balancing Priorities:** Managers must ensure that both technical and sales goals are met without compromising either side.

#### 2. Managing and Leading a Diverse Team

**Skill Diversity:** SE teams often consist of individuals with varying skill sets. Managers need a tailored approach to maximize each team member’s contribution.

**Motivation and Retention**: Keeping the team motivated and engaged, especially under high pressure, can be challenging.

#### 3. Handling Complex Customer Requirements

**Customizing Solutions**: Many customers have specific needs. Ensuring the team designs technically feasible, scalable solutions while aligning with the sales strategy is essential.

**Managing Expectations:** Managing customer expectations and preventing misalignments is crucial to avoid dissatisfaction.

#### 4. Balancing Technical Depth with Sales Goals

**Sales Pressure:** SE managers must balance the depth of technical solutions with the urgency of closing deals.

**Focus on Business Value:** It’s important for the team to understand not only the technical merits of a solution but also its business value to the customer.

#### 5. Managing Complex Sales Cycles

**Long Sales Cycles:** SE managers must support their team through long and intricate sales cycles, providing consistent value from prospecting to deal closure.

**Adapting to Change:** As customer requirements evolve, the team must remain flexible and provide updated solutions when needed.

#### 6. Training and Development

**Technical Skills:** Ensuring that the team is well-versed in the latest technologies and product updates is time-consuming but vital.

**Soft Skills:** Effective communication and presentation skills are just as important as technical knowledge in SEs.

#### 7. Cross-Department Collaboration

**Coordination:** Coordinating with multiple departments, such as product management and operations, to deliver the right solution requires strong organizational skills.

**Aligning Expectations:** Different teams may have competing priorities, so managing expectations across departments is essential.

#### 8. Technology and Tools Management

**Tool Management:** The SE function uses various tools, such as CRMs and proposal management software, which must be optimized for efficiency.

**Adapting to New Tools:** The introduction of new tools may disrupt workflows, but effective management can improve team efficiency.

#### 9. Meeting Revenue Targets

**Sales Contribution:** Although SE teams are not directly responsible for closing deals, their technical contributions are crucial to driving revenue.

**Forecasting and Reporting:** Accurate forecasting ensures that opportunities are qualified and the pipeline stays full.

#### 10. Competitive Pressure

**Market Competition:** SE managers need to ensure that their team not only has technical proficiency but is also aware of competitor offerings and how to differentiate their company’s products.

**Innovation:** Continuous innovation is necessary to highlight the unique value proposition, especially in highly competitive markets.

#### 11. Customer Retention and Upselling

**Post-Sale Engagement:** Ensuring that customer success teams are aligned and identifying opportunities for upselling and cross-selling after the deal is closed is crucial.

#### **Conclusion**

No matter how you look at it, the Presales function is essential for any company trying to take technology to market.  This is obviously more relevant in a B2B enviroment, and when there is a degree of complexity, integration and business value attached to the solution.  Building, developping and leading a Presales organisation is a demanding task requiring a broad set of skills and attributes.  Don't hesitate to get in touch if I can be of assistance.
