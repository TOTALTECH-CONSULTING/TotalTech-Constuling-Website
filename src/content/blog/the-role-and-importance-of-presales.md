**The Role and Importance of the Presales  Function**

In this article, I will use *Presales* as a broad term to encompass roles such as Sales Engineering,
Solution Engineering, Solution Consulting, Technology Consulting, and Technical
Sales. Additionally, I will refer to an *SE (Sales Engineer)* as a professional working
within the Presales function, which includes titles like Presales Consultant,
Solution Consultant, Technical Consultant, and Technical Seller.

 The Presales function is essential for any organization that sells technology. While the
technology itself can vary, its complexity dictates the need for SEs. For basic
products or services, post-sales technical support may suffice, and in smaller
companies, this role may even overlap with engineering. However, as technology
grows more complex and valuable, the need for a dedicated SE team becomes more
apparent.

 The Presales function acts as the bridge connecting various departments: sales, product
management, engineering, marketing, technical support, operations, senior
leadership, and partners. Below, I outline how SEs work across these teams:

#### 
**1. Sales**

	• Collaboration: SEs work closely with the sales team to understand customer needs and customize solutions. They provide technical expertise and address any technical questions early in the sales process.

	• Support: They assist in presentations, product demos, and technical proof of concepts (POCs) to help close deals.

	• Bridge: Acting as a liaison, SEs ensure the technical aspects of a solution align with customer requirements.

#### 2. Product Management/Engineering

	• Feedback Loop: SEs offer valuable customer insights, including preferences, pain points, and feature requests.

	• Customization: They collaborate with product teams to tailor solutions that address specific customer needs, especially for complex products.

#### 3. Marketing

	• Content Development: SEs contribute to the creation of technical content like whitepapers, case studies, and solution briefs, emphasizing the product's technical strengths.

	• Customer Insights: They provide input on market trends and customer demands, helping to position products effectively.

#### 4. Customer/Technical Support

	• Implementation Support: Post-sale, SEs may assist customer support teams to ensure smooth technical implementations and resolve issues promptly.

	• Knowledge Transfer: They ensure a seamless transition from sales to support, equipping the team with the necessary technical knowledge.

#### 5. Operations

	• Solution Delivery: SEs collaborate with the operations team to ensure the proposed solution is operationally feasible.

	• Risk Management: They identify potential risks and work with other teams to address them during implementation.

#### 6. Senior Leadership (C-Level or Executive Team)

	• Strategic Input: SEs provide feedback to senior leadership on customer demands, competitive positioning, and market opportunities, which helps shape business decisions and product roadmaps.

#### 7. External Partners/Alliances

	• Partnerships: SEs work with third-party vendors or resellers to integrate solutions and offer joint products to customers.

	• Collaboration for Complex Deals: They collaborate with external partners to provide specialized technical solutions for large or complex sales.



In summary, Presales serves a critical role in aligning technical and business objectives, ensuring successful sales and customer satisfaction.
